# Deploy multiple applications to multiple clusters
# We have seen how you can deploy a single application to multiple clusters and how to deploy many applications in a single cluster in the previous exercises.

# But of course the ultimate goal is to have multiple applications to multiple clusters. Instead of providing yet another generator for this particular scenario, ArgoCD has a Matrix generator that combines two existing generators and creates all possible combinations.

# In our case we can use a matrix generator to combine:

# the cluster generator from the previous exercise to iterate over connected clusters
# the Git generator from the previous exercise to iterate over application folders.
# This way we get a matrix of all applications deployed on all clusters. In our case we have 3 clusters and 4 applications so our matrix generator will create 12 applications for us !

# Create a matrix generator.
# First read the documentation of the matrix generator at [https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/applicationset/Generators-Matrix/].

# In your own Github repo
# Copy the file application-sets/generators/many-apps-many-cluster.yml to application-sets/my-application-sets
# Optionally delete application-sets/my-application-sets/single-app-multiple-clusters.yml to remove the previous example
# You need to edit the file many-apps-many-cluster.yml to address the previous scenarios (4 applications over 3 clusters). Here are some hints

# Change the repoURL for the Git section to https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/gitops-cert-level-2-examples.git
# Change the path section for the directories propery to application-sets/example-apps/*
# Remove the label selector from the cluster generator and choose all clusters
# Use 'default' project in all clusters
# Change the repoUL for the application template to https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/gitops-cert-level-2-examples.git
# Add a syncpolicy for auto-sync/self-heal/createNamespace
# See the previous examples we deployed for the Git and cluster generator for more details.

# Commit and push your changes. Refresh manually the my-application-sets application in UI instead of waiting for ArgoCD to pick up the changes.

# You should now see 12 total applications (4 applications on 3 clusters).
